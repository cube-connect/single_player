## How to build
    git clone https://github.com/Yossari4n/SolarSystem.git
    cd RubiksCube
    mkdir build && cd build
    conan install ..
    cmake .. -G

To properly load resources and shaders source code make sure you have your executable path set up correctly - preferably pointing to the root of a project. Or copy 'resources' and 'src/shaders' directories to your build target directory.
